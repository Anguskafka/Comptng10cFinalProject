# Comptng10cFinalProject
this is the final project for comptng10c
This project is created by QT creator.
It creates a GUI that is used with the purpose of text processing, a test passage is included in the test.txt file.
The project opens the test.txt file and display the text on the GUI interface, and using functions presented on the GUI
we can achieve multiple purpose.  Firstly, the lookup button prompt the program to find the first occurence of the input word
from the line field and highlight the word in the displayed passage.  Pressing it second time would prompt the next occurence of
the word to be highlighted. The two radio buttons are word count and word statistics.  Selecting the word count button will prompt
a display of total word count and unique word count.  Selecting the word statistics will prompt a display a list of words from the
passage from the most frequent word to the least frequent.
